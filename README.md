<h2>About the project.</h2>
<br>
<p>Bistro cafe is actually just a template that I used for developing a real site for a client, a restaurant from my hometown where I used to spend my early mornings when I was in highschool. The client requested the real site to be private ( on request I can provide the url).</p>
<br>
<p>The thing I liked the most about this project was playing around with framer-motion and the pallete of colors</p>
